# docker-wallabag

Dockerfile used to build a wallabag docker image.

This was forked from bobmaerten/docker-wallabag to eliminate the script for persistance in favor of a volume and to better conform to best practices for unRAID Docker.

## Usage from index.docker.io

    ID=$(sudo docker run -p 7070:80 -d zuhkov/docker-wallabag:latest /sbin/my_init)

Then head your browser to http://localhost:7070 and enjoy a fresh wallabag install.

Login with Username and password `wallabag`. Don't forget to change your password!

When you're finished, just stop the docker container:

    sudo docker stop $ID

Check the [phusion/baseimage](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker) documentation for all kind of options and switches.

## Persistance of the database

Persistance is accomplished with a Volume containing the folder with the sqlite database.

    docker run -p 7070:80/tcp -d -v "/where/you/want/to/store/db":"/var/www/wallabag/db" zuhkov/docker-wallabag /sbin/my_init

## Using ENV variable to pass SALT value in config file

You can specify a `--env WALLABAG_SALT=<insert salt value here>` in the docker run command in order to fix the salt value in the wallabag config file on container startup.
Example:

    sudo docker run -p 7070:80 -d --env WALLABAG_SALT=34gAogagAigJaurgbqfdvqQergvqer zuhkov/docker-wallabag:latest /sbin/my_init

NOTE: This option should not be used until

## building from Dockerfile

    sudo docker build -t docker-wallabag .
